# 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

Transport services and protocols
- provide ==logical== communication between application processes running on different hosts
- transport protocols actions in end systems:
	- sender: breaks application messages into ==segments==, passes to  network layer
	- receiver: ==reassembles== segments into messages, passes to application layer重组报文段成报文，然后传递给应用层
- two transport protocols available to Internet applications
	- TCP, UDP

## 3.1.1 Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers

Transport vs. network layer services and protocols
household analogy:
12 kids in Ann’s house sending letters to 12 kids in Bill’s house:
- hosts = houses
- processes = kids
- app messages = letters in envelopes
- transport protocol = Ann and Bill who demux to in-house siblings
- network-layer protocol = postal service邮政服务

- transport layer: communication between processes
	- relies on, enhances, network layer services依赖并加强网络层的服务
	- 依赖于网络层的服务
		- 延时、带宽
	- 对网络层的服务进行加强
		- 数据丢失、顺序混乱、加密
- network layer: communication between hosts
有些服务是可以加强的：不可靠->可靠；安全
但有些服务是不可以被加强的：带宽，延迟



## 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet

Transport Layer Actions
Sender:
- is passed an application-layer message
- determines segment header fields values
- creates segment
- passes segment to IP
Receiver:
- receives segment from IP
- checks header values
- extracts application-layer message
- demultiplexes message up to application via socket

Two principal Internet transport protocols
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
- reliable, in-order delivery
- congestion control
- flow control
- connection setup
UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- unreliable, unordered delivery
- no-frills extension of “best-effort” IP没有为尽力而为的IP服务添加更多的其他额外服务
services not available:都不提供的服务
- delay guarantees
- bandwidth guarantees

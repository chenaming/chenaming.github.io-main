# 3.6 Principles of Congestion Control

Congestion:
- informally: “too many sources sending too much data too fast for network to handle”
- manifestations:
	- long delays (queueing in router buffers)
	- packet loss (buffer overflow at routers)

different from flow control!
a top-10 problem!

congestion control: too many senders, sending too fast
flow control: one sender too fast for one receiver

## 3.6.1 The Causes and the Costs of Congestion



### Scenario 1: Two Senders, a Router with Infinite Buffers

Causes/costs of congestion: scenario 1

Fugure 3.43 Congestion scenario 1: Two connections sharing a single hop with indinite buffers


Simplest scenario:
- one router, infinite buffers
- input, output link capacity: R
- two flows
- no retransmissions needed


Q: What happens as arrival rate lin approaches R/2?

- 拥塞时分组延迟太大
- 达到最大throughput


### Scenario 2: Two Senders and a Router with Finite Buffers

- one router, finite buffers
- sender retransmits lost, timed-out packet
	- application-layer input = application-layer output: lin = lout
	- transport-layer input includes retransmissions : l’in    lin

情况a:
Idealization: perfect knowledge
- sender sends only when router buffers available

情况b:
Idealization: some perfect knowledge
- packets can be lost (dropped at router) due  to full buffers
- sender knows when packet has been dropped: only resends if packet known to be lost

情况c:
Idealization: some perfect knowledge
- packets can be lost (dropped at router) due  to full buffers
- sender knows when packet has been dropped: only resends if packet known to be lost

Realistic scenario: un-needed duplicates
- packets can be lost, dropped at router due  to full buffers – requiring retransmissions
- but sender times can time out prematurely, sending two copies, both of which are delivered


“costs” of congestion:
- more work (retransmission) for given receiver throughput
- unneeded retransmissions: link carries multiple copies of a packet
	- decreasing maximum achievable throughput

### Scenario 3: Four Senders, Routers with Finite Buffers, and Multihop Paths

Causes/costs of congestion: scenario 3

four senders
multi-hop paths
timeout/retransmit

Q: what happens as lin and lin’ increase ?
A: 
as red  lin’ increases, all arriving blue pkts at upper queue are dropped, blue throughput -> 0


another “cost” of congestion:
- when packet dropped, any upstream transmission capacity and buffering used for that packet was wasted!

## 3.6.2 Approaches to Congestion Control



![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/ce54a1eff44942a2bd3bdec3091c78e1.png#pic_center)

Approaches towards congestion control
End-end congestion control:
- no explicit feedback from network
- congestion inferred from observed loss, delay
- approach taken by TCP

Network-assisted congestion control:
- routers provide direct feedback to sending/receiving hosts with flows passing through congested router
- may indicate congestion level or explicitly set sending rate
- TCP ECN, ATM, DECbit protocols
- 简单的拥塞指示(1 bit): SNA,DECbit,TCP/IP ECN,ATM

# 3.3 Connectionless Transport: UDP

UDP: User Datagram Protocol [RFC 768]
- “no frills,” “bare bones” Internet transport protocol
- “best effort” service, UDP segments may be:
	- lost
	- delivered out-of-order to app
- connectionless:
	- no handshaking between UDP sender, receiver
	- each UDP segment handled independently of others

Why is there a UDP?
- no connection establishment (which can add RTT delay)
- simple: no connection state at sender, receiver
- small header size
- no congestion control
	- UDP can blast away as fast as desired!
	- can function in the face of congestion

- UDP use:
	- streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
	- DNS
	- SNMP
	- HTTP/3
- if reliable transfer needed over UDP (e.g., HTTP/3):
	- add needed reliability at application layer
	- add congestion control at application layer



## 3.3.1 UDP Segment Structure

UDP: Transport Layer Actions
UDP sender actions:
is passed an application-layer message
determines UDP segment header fields values
creates UDP segment
passes segment to IP

length, in bytes of UDP segment, including header
data to/from application layer

## 3.3.2 UDP Checksum

Goal: detect errors (i.e., flipped bits) in transmitted segment

Internet checksum
sender:
- treat contents of UDP segment (including UDP header fields and IP addresses) as sequence of 16-bit integers
- checksum: addition (one’s complement sum) of segment content
- checksum value put into UDP checksum field
receiver:
- compute checksum of received segment
- check if computed checksum equals checksum field value:
	- not equal - error detected
	- equal - no error detected. But maybe errors nonetheless? More later ….
Even though numbers have changed (bit flips), no change in checksum!残存错误

Internet checksum: an example

Note: when adding numbers, a carryout from the most significant bit needs to be added to the result


Summary: UDP
- “no frills” protocol:
	- segments may be lost, delivered out of order
	- best effort service: “send and hope for the best”
- UDP has its plusses:
	- no setup/handshaking needed (no RTT incurred)
	- can function when network service is compromised
	- helps with reliability (checksum)
- build additional functionality on top of UDP in application layer (e.g., HTTP/3)

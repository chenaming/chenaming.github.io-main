什么是可靠？
- 不错、不丢、不乱
可靠数据传输协议
- 可靠数据传输对应用层、传输层、链路层都很重要
- 网络top10问题
- 信道的不可靠特性决定了可靠数据传输协议(rdt)的复杂性

Complexity of reliable data transfer protocol  will depend (strongly) on characteristics of unreliable channel (lose, corrupt, reorder data?)
Sender, receiver do not know the “state” of each other, e.g., was a message received?
- unless communicated via a message

Reliable data transfer protocol (rdt): interfaces
rdt_send(): called from above, (e.g., by app.). Passed data to deliver to receiver upper layer

udt_send(): called by rdt to transfer packet over unreliable channel to receiver

deliver_data(): called by rdt to deliver data to upper layer

rdt_rcv(): called when packet arrives on receiver side of channel


Reliable data transfer: getting started
We will:
- incrementally develop sender, receiver sides of reliable data transfer protocol (rdt)
- consider only unidirectional data transfer
	- but control info will flow in both directions!
- use finite state machines (FSM)  to specify sender, receiver

## 3.4.1 Building a Reliable Data Transfer Protocol


### Reliable Data Transfer over a Perfectly Reliable Channel: rdt1.0

- underlying channel perfectly reliable
	- no bit errors
	- no loss of packets
- separate FSMs for sender, receiver:
	- sender sends data into underlying channel
	- receiver reads data from underlying channel

### Reliable Data Transfer over a Channel with Bit Errors: rdt2.0

- underlying channel may flip bits in packet底层信道可能翻转分组中的位
	- checksum (e.g., Internet checksum) to detect bit errors
- the question: how to recover from errors?

> [!question] How do humans recover from “errors” during conversation?
> 

•acknowledgements (==ACKs==): receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt received OK

•negative acknowledgements (==NAKs==): receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt had errors

•sender ==retransmits== pkt on receipt of NAK

基于这种重传机制的rdt协议称为ARQ(Automatic Repeat reQuest)协议

Rdt2.0中引入的新机制
- 差错检测
- 接收方反馈控制信息：ACK/NAK
- 重传

stop and wait
sender sends one packet,  then waits for receiver  response

rdt2.0: FSM specifications
Rdt 2.0: FSM规约

Note: “state” of receiver (did the receiver get my message correctly?) isn’t known to sender unless somehow communicated from receiver to sender
- that’s why we need a protocol!

rdt2.0: operation with no errors
rdt2.0: corrupted packet scenario



rdt2.0 has a fatal flaw!
what happens if ACK/NAK corrupted?
- sender doesn’t know what happened at receiver!
	- 为ACK/NAK增加校验和，检错并纠错
	- 发送方收到被破坏ACK/NAK时不知道接收方发生了什么，添加额外的控制消息
	- 如果ACK/NAK坏掉，发送方重传
	- 不能简单的重传：产生重复分组
- can’t just retransmit: possible duplicate
handling duplicates:
- sender retransmits current pkt if ACK/NAK corrupted
- sender adds ==sequence number== to each pkt
- receiver discards (doesn’t deliver up) duplicate pkt


rdt2.1: sender, handling garbled ACK/NAKs

rdt2.1: receiver, handling garbled ACK/NAKs
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/2befc9ff45ae4a64a1c72c340eb52d2a.png#pic_center)

rdt2.1: discussion

sender:
- seq # added to pkt
- two seq. # s(0,1) will suffice.  Why?
- must check if received ACK/NAK corrupted
- twice as many states
	- state must “remember” whether “expected” pkt should have seq # of 0 or 1
receiver:
- must check if received packet is duplicate
	- state indicates whether 0 or 1 is expected pkt seq #
- note: receiver can not know if its last ACK/NAK received OK at sender

我们真的需要两种确认消息（ACK+NAK）吗？
rdt2.2: a NAK-free protocol
- same functionality as rdt2.1, using ACKs only
- instead of NAK, receiver sends ACK for last pkt received OK
	- receiver must explicitly include seq # of pkt being ACKed
- duplicate ACK at sender results in same action as NAK: retransmit current pkt

As we will see, TCP uses this approach to be NAK-free

### Reliable Data Transfer over a Lossy Channel with Bit Errors: rdt3.0

rdt3.0: channels with errors and loss

New channel assumption: underlying channel can also lose packets (data, ACKs)

•checksum, sequence # s, ACKs, retransmissions will be of help … but not quite enough


> [!question] Q: How do humans handle lost sender-to-receiver words in conversation?
> 


Approach: sender waits “reasonable” amount of time for ACK
- retransmits if no ACK received in this time
- if pkt (or ACK) just delayed (not lost):
	- retransmission will be  duplicate, but seq # s already handles this!
	- receiver must specify seq # of packet being ACKed
- use countdown timer to interrupt after “reasonable” amount of time

## 3.4.2 Pipelined Reliable Data Transfer Protocols


Performance of rdt3.0 (stop-and-wait)
- U sender: utilization – fraction of time sender busy sending
- example: 1 Gbps link, 15 ms prop. delay, 8000 bit packet
	- time to transmit packet into channel:
Dtrans=L(packet length in bits)/R(transmission rate,bps)=8000 bits/109 bits/sec=8 microsecs

发送方利用率：发送方发送时间百分比

rdt 3.0 protocol performance stinks!
Protocol limits performance of underlying infrastructure (channel)

rdt3.0: pipelined protocols operation
pipelining: sender allows multiple, “in-flight”, yet-to-be-acknowledged packets
•range of sequence numbers must be increased
•buffering at sender and/or receiver

## 3.4.3 Go-Back-N(GBN)


滑动窗口协议：Sliding-window protocol
窗口
- 允许使用的序列号范围
- 窗口尺寸为N：最多有N个等待确认的消息
滑动窗口
- 随着协议的运行，窗口在序列号空间内向前滑动
滑动窗口协议：GBN,SR

Go-Back-N: sender
- sender: “window” of up to N, consecutive transmitted but unACKed pkts
	- k-bit seq # in pkt header

- cumulative ACK: ACK(n): ACKs all packets up to, including seq # n
	- on receiving ACK(n): move window forward to begin at n+1
- timer for oldest in-flight packet
- timeout(n): retransmit packet n and all higher seq # packets in window

- ACK-only: always send ACK for correctly-received packet so far, with highest in-order seq #
	- may generate duplicate ACKs
	- need only remember rcv_base
- on receipt of out-of-order packet:
	- can discard (don’t buffer) or buffer: an implementation decision
	- re-ACK pkt with highest in-order seq #


Go-Back-N in action

## 3.4.4 Selective Repeat(SR)

- GBN有什么缺陷？
- 接收方对每个分组单独进行确认
	- 设置缓存机制，缓存乱序到达的分组
- 发送方只重传那些没收到ACK的分组
	- 为每个分组设置定时器
- 发送方窗口
	- N个连续的序列号
	- 限制已发送且未确认的分组


Selective repeat: the approach
- pipelining:  multiple packets in flight
- receiver individually ACKs all correctly received packets
	- buffers packets, as needed, for in-order delivery to upper layer
sender:
- maintains (conceptually) a timer for each unACKed pkt
	- timeout: retransmits single unACKed packet  associated with timeout
- maintains (conceptually) “window” over  N consecutive seq # s
	- limits pipelined, “in flight” packets to be within this window


Selective repeat: sender, receiver windows

Selective repeat: sender and receiver

![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/ce6d2443fac3444ba48aba0abbcc73ca.png#pic_center)
sender
data from above:
- if next available seq # in window, send packet
timeout(n):
- resend packet n, restart timer
ACK(n) in 【sendbase,sendbase+N-1】:
- mark packet n as received
- if n smallest unACKed packet, advance window base to next unACKed seq #


![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/32cd7e15c6a348d795fe1afda4074c8b.png#pic_center)

receiver
packet n in [rcvbase, rcvbase+N-1]
- send ACK(n)
- out-of-order: buffer
- in-order: deliver (also deliver buffered, in-order packets), advance window to next not-yet-received packet
packet n in [rcvbase-N,rcvbase-1]
- ACK(n)
otherwise:
- ignore


Selective Repeat in action

Selective repeat:  a dilemma!
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/4e604a80ee91411e9776ac6a31477ecb.png#pic_center)
example:

seq # s: 0, 1, 2, 3 (base 4 counting)
window size=3

receiver can’t see sender side

receiver behavior identical in both cases!

something’s (very) wrong!

Q: what relationship is needed between sequence # size and window size to avoid problem in scenario (b)?
